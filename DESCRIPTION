Title: Rcpp Example of Using Iconv Offered by R
Version: 0.0.1

Description: Character conversion via the 'iconv' library is used by R itself, and can be
 accessed from compiled code relying on one standard header exported by R. This package
 illustrates this usage by building on and extending an earlier example in a blog post at
 <https://fishandwhistle.net/post/2021/using-rs-cross-platform-iconv-wrapper-from-cpp11/>.
 Rcpp is used only for its convenience of seamlessly building the package, and converting
 between character variable at the R and C++ levels.
